# Anchor's Portfolio

Anchor's Portfolio is a React & Next.JS website for the purpose of showacasing my previous work

## Installation

Use the NPM package manager to install the portfolio.

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

```dev launch
yarn dev

```build
yarn build 

```

Please don't judge my code too much. It is a little messy but I tried to keep it as readable as possible. This was a learning project for me as I only learned React about a year ago
