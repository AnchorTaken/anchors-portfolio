What makes up for that is the fully online functionallity and collaborative work. I am very experienced when it comes to sheets and can easily say it would not take me any effort to make a sheets document. I have used sheets to make personal tracking sheets for finances, documents to aid in structuring my sense of direction and organisation amongs many many things. My most complex sheet was created when I was very heavily involved in a trading scene of an online game. The game has a ton of items that have real life value and I wanted to see the kind of results I was getting buying certain items. I started by mentally tracking the prices of items and doing my best to estimate the value of my investments. That didn't go very far. When you are buying and selling thousands of items it becomes virtually impossible to track the prices. So I started using sheets. I began by writing down the prices of items in the doc but that also would not be sustainable as there are just too many items to update. I then found out that sheets come preinstalled with a web scraper. So I sat down one day and scraped the links for all the prices. Then I made it pretty and easy to read and violla. I have a spredsheet that updates itself and can show me where I stand.\n\nps: that same spreadsheet is also saving all the prices onto another page so that i can see the price progression over time and make better educated gueeses\n",

I can make banners as my twitter banner shows and am very capable but if the source image is not good enough the result will suffer in quality. Photoshop is essential for me as a designer as most of the time the image that you get is simply not good enough to go on the home page as a banner and a few simple tweaks to colors and crop can do wonders for the overall feel of the image.
